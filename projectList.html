        Here is just a list of all the projects I've worked on that couldn't justify their own pages. Either they had no visual component, I'm not supposed to show 
        the visual component, or they just didn't belong on any of the other pages.

          This project was a part of the field session experience at Colorado School of Mines. I, along with a team of other students, created a mobile game app which was 
        controlled via a balance board. The balance board contained an IMU which communicated with the app through a BLE connection. The entire project was completed under
        advisement from a client outside the university. The client's goal for the project was to create an engaging and fun form of physical therapy, specifically for older
        adults. 
        <br><br>
          The app itself was created using the Flutter framework for the Dart language. Within that, the Flutter Flame game engine was used for the game section of the app.
        Logs of IMU data were kept from each game session if the user so chose. This functionality was added at the request of our client so that they might review data from multiple 
        trials in order to track a user's progress in mastery of the game and physical fitness. 
        <br><br>
          The entire project was completed in 15 weeks averaging about 10 hours per person per week. The first two weeks were largely spent familiarizing ourselves with Flutter
        and Dart, while the rest wer real programming for the final product.
